Welcome to my repository where I embark on a 10-day Java programming adventure, tackling different concepts and challenges each day! Here's the itinerary:

Day 00: Structures and Arrays  
Day 01: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Collections

Each folder in this repository represents a day, containing exercises, examples, and notes related to the day's topic. Feel free to explore, clone, and practice along. Pull requests are more than welcome if you'd like to contribute or share your solutions.
