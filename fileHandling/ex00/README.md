## File Signature Checker

Welcome to the File Signature Checker - your trusty sidekick in the digital realm! 🌟 This nifty Java application is like a detective for files, peeking into their very souls (or headers, to be precise) to determine their true identities. Have a mysterious file that's playing hard to get with its format? Fear not! Our File Signature Checker is here to unveil its secrets. 🕵️‍♂️🔍    

# What Does This Do?

Think of this application as a digital Sherlock Holmes. It examines the beginning bytes (the "magic numbers") of a file and tells you what file type it is, be it a PNG, JPG, or the elusive PDF! It's like magic, but with bytes and a lot of Java coffee! ☕️✨   

# How It Works

Mystery Solver: Give it a file, and it delves deep into its bytes, comparing them with known file signatures.  
Byte Whisperer: It reads the bytes and speaks 'Hexadecimal', translating those tricky hex values into something we mere mortals can understand.  
Matchmaker: It matches the read bytes with a list of known file signatures and finds the perfect pair, just like a digital cupid! 🏹❤️
