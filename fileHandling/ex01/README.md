## Text Similarity Analyzer

Welcome to the Text Similarity Analyzer, a sophisticated Java-based tool that uncovers the similarity between two text documents using advanced frequency analysis. Designed for ease of use and efficiency, this tool employs the principles of Cosine Similarity to deliver insightful comparisons.  

# How It Works  

The Text Similarity Analyzer operates on the principle of Cosine Similarity, a metric used to measure how similar the documents are irrespective of their size. This method involves analyzing the frequency of words in each document, creating a unique dictionary, and then computing a similarity score based on these frequencies.  

# Example

    $ java TextSimilarityAnalyzer inputA.txt inputB.txt
    Similarity = 0.54  

This score indicates the degree of similarity between inputA.txt and inputB.txt based on their word usage.
