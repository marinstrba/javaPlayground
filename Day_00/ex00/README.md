# Sum of Digits Calculator
This Java program calculates the sum of the digits of a six-digit integer. The integer value is set directly in the code by explicitly initializing the number variable.

# Code Explanation
A six-digit integer number is initialized directly in the code.
The program then calculates the sum of the digits of the integer by repeatedly taking the remainder of the number when divided by 10 (to get the last digit) and adding it to the sum. The number is then divided by 10 to remove the last digit.
The sum of the digits is then displayed as output.

# Notes
The number must be a six-digit integer. If not, the program will not work correctly.
